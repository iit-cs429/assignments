""" Assignment 0

You will implement a simple in-memory boolean search engine over the jokes
from http://web.hawkesnest.net/~jthens/laffytaffy/.

The documents are read from documents.txt.
The queries to be processed are read from queries.txt.

Your search engine will only need to support AND queries. A multi-word query
is assumed to be an AND of the words. E.g., the query "why because" should be
processed as "why AND because."

      A list of strings, one per token.
    Here is a doctest:

      An inverted index. This is a dict where keys are words and values are

    3. Intersect the postings list of each word in the query.

    If a query term is not in the index, then an empty list should be returned.

    Params:
      index...An inverted index (dict mapping words to document ids)
      query...A string that may contain multiple search terms. We assume the
      query is the AND of those terms by default.
